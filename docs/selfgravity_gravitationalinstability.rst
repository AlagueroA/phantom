Simulation of self-gravitating and gravitationally unstable accretion discs
====================================================================

In PHANTOM, it is possible to perform simulations of accretion discs taking into account the role of the disc self-gravity and, possibly, to trigger gravitational instability. 

Self-gravity in (vertically isothermal) accretion discs
------------------
Normally in the *disc* and *dustydisc* environments the disc self-gravity is taken into account. Indeed, usually the disc to star mass ratio is so low that the disc contribution to the gravitational potential is negligible. 
The setups *isosgdisc* and *dustyisosgdisc* allow simulating vertically isothermal discs with self-gravity and disc viscosity ($Î±_{SS}$), and work as the *disc* and *dustydisc* ones.
